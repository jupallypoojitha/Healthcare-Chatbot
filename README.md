It provides a comprehensive guide to building a talking healthcare chatbot using deep learning. Here's a summary of the key steps:

Imports and Setup:

Necessary modules like random, json, pickle, nltk, and tensorflow are imported.
Explanation of key modules:
nltk (Natural Language Toolkit) is used for NLP tasks.
WordNetLemmatizer lemmatizes words for consistent analysis.
Sequential model from Keras simplifies the neural network structure.
Dense, Dropout, and Activation layers build the network.
SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) optimizer is used to optimize the model.
Loading and Preparing Data:

JSON data, representing diseases, symptoms, and responses, is loaded.
The data is tokenized, lemmatized, and cleaned by removing special characters.
Data is split into words, classes (diseases), and documents (symptom-tag pairs).
Data Serialization:

The processed words and classes are saved using the pickle module for later use.
Data Conversion for Neural Network:

Data is converted into numerical values using a Bag of Words model.
Data is shuffled and split into features (train_x) and labels (train_y).
Model Training:

A Sequential model is created with several layers.
The model is compiled using the SGD optimizer and trained for 200 epochs.
The trained model is saved as "chatbot_model.h5".
Making the Chatbot Speak:

The chatbot uses a pre-trained model to predict diseases based on symptoms.
The user interacts with the bot through voice, and the bot responds in both text and voice formats.
Complete Code for the Chatbot:

The full code integrates speech recognition, NLP, and the trained model to build a working healthcare chatbot.
The chatbot takes voice input, processes it, predicts the disease, and provides feedback.
This tutorial demonstrates how to combine NLP, deep learning, and speech recognition to create an interactive and functional healthcare chatbot.

OVERVIEW 
This project aims to build a healthcare chatbot that not only understands and responds to spoken inputs, making it more user-friendly and accessible. The chatbot is trained on a dataset of disease symptoms and corresponding diagnoses, enabling it to identify patterns and provide accurate predictions. The use of deep learning techniques ensures that the model continuously improves as it encounters more data, making it a valuable tool in modern healthcare settings.
